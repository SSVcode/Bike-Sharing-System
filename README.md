# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service where bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, either for a price or for free. Typically, users borrow bikes from a computer-controlled dock by entering payment information, and the system unlocks the bike. The bike can then be returned to any dock in the same system.

The US-based bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently experienced a significant decline in revenues due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This challenging market scenario has made it difficult for the company to sustain operations. To address this, BoomBikes aims to develop a strategic business plan to boost its revenue post-lockdown as the economy recovers.

## Objective
BoomBikes seeks to understand the demand for shared bikes after the quarantine period ends, allowing them to:
- Prepare effectively to meet the anticipated demand.
- Stand out from competitors.
- Maximize profitability.

To achieve this, BoomBikes has partnered with a consulting company to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The analysis focuses on:
1. Identifying significant variables that predict bike-sharing demand.
2. Assessing how well these variables explain the variation in bike demand.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises daily bike demand data collected across the American market, influenced by:
- Meteorological factors.
- People's lifestyle preferences.

The insights derived from this analysis will enable BoomBikes to make informed decisions and thrive in a post-pandemic market environment.
